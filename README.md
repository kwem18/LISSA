# LISSA Satellite SDR Project

This is the codeused for our senior design project at George Mason University.

The code was created to use GNU Radio with the Lime SDR to transmit and receive files over Inmarsat's L-Band Satellite Network.

Our sponsers for this project are Inmarsat, MicroAnt, and Tektronix.
